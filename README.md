## Power from solar cells

### Characteristic curve

Definitions:
* IV-Curve: Curve obtained when the load is varied and the voltage and aperage is recorded.
  
  ![characteristic_curve]
* _I<sub>sc</sub>_: is the _short circuit current_. It is the maximum current provided by the solar cell (as if the panel has _R = 0_.
  
* _V<sub>oc</sub>_: is the _open circuit voltage_. It is the maximum voltage a solar cell will supply (as if the panel has _R = âˆž_).
  
* _MPP_ is the maximum power point. It is the maximum _P_ a solar cell can provided.
